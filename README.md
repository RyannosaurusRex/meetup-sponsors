## Meetup-Sponsors

I've been running TriJS for almost 3 years, and have been involved in local meetups and user groups long before that. They're great ways to learn something new, meet new people, and update your skills - but some aspects cost time, space, and money. I've been lucky enough to have incredible venue, food, and swag/giveaway sponsors with TriJS, and wanted to put together a resource for other developers and meetup organizers to use to find sponsors for their meetups.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/RyannosaurusRex/meetupsponsors.github.io/edit/master/src/static/data.json) and create a pull request to submit a public sponsor that isn't already here.

Before committing, please run `npm run build` in order to generate the site (until I can get a proper build system set up.).
